# RaspberryPiHackathonFeb2022
Testing the new camera library on the Raspberry Pi for the Cambridge Engineering Society Hackathon.

Project: Gesture recognition using edge-computing

Using the new camera library and Python sockets, we send image data in real time to a edge serve from the Pi for image processing. We use an open-source gesture model to match fingers to corresponding numbers. We then send commands back to the Pi to enable camera functions.
